# Hacking GraphQL
## lab-setup.sh
This script automates the lab setup described in the book, [Black Hat GraphQL by Dolev Farhi, Nick Aleks](https://nostarch.com/black-hat-graphql). A few tools have changed since the book was published, so for them the steps mentioned in the book do not work anymore. This script uses the updated steps to install / setup / configure those tools.
