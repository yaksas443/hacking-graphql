# Hacking GraphQL
## Setting up the lab
You can use lab-setup.sh script to setup a GraphQL lab from scratch. This script primarily automates the lab setup described in the book, [Black Hat GraphQL by Dolev Farhi, Nick Aleks](https://nostarch.com/black-hat-graphql). It does a few addtional things as well. Some tools (like InQL) have changed since the book was published, so for them the steps mentioned in the book do not work anymore. This script uses the updated steps to install / setup / configure those tools.

### Steps to execute
This script can be run on a freshly installed Ubuntu 22.04 VM. Follow the steps below:
 - Copy and paste contents of this script in file. Save the file with .sh extension. For example, lab-setup.sh
 - Open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and navigate to the folder where this script is stored.
 - Issue this command (gives execute permission to the script): `chmod +x lab-setup.sh`
 - Execute the script: `./lab-steup.sh`
